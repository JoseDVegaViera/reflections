How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because, if the old version was working properly you can be sure that any 
    modiffication was the cause of the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can easily compare with older, more stable versions when you
    are in trouble.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros, you only commit when you are committed to change the file. 
    Automatically save everithing could save unnoticed changes. A con may
    be that you need extra time to do the task.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	I think it's because in many situations you need to work with more than one
	file at a time because they are related. That's the case when you edit an
	html and css.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows you the history, and with git diff you look at the differences
    between two files in the history with theirs id.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
